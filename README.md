1. Map out your components and your component flow

    Per the read me we have ...

        App

        Filters

        PetBrowser

        Pet

    App has two children, Filters and PetBrowser
    PetBrowser has some children (the count is dynamic), called Pet

2. Take some time to look at (and understand) the code that's already been given
